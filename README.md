# fillit Made by: dzui and mpaziuk
Fillit is a project who let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring
problematic in programming : searching for the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities.
In this particular project, you will be charged of creating an algorithm which
fits some Tetriminos together into the smallest possible square.

The goal of this project is to arrange the Tetriminos among themselves to make the
smallest possible square, but in some cases, this square may have holes when some given
pieces wonâ€™t fit perfectly with others.
